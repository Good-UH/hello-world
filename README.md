Hello Humans!

Juan here, I enjoy coding using C++, Python, and Java. I am currently learning new languages and am programming using C# and SQL. I've used Eclipse, Python 3.6, Visual Studio, and SQL Management Studio to code.
I am a 2018 graduate from the University of Houston and I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I began my career in February 2019 and am currently employed for Pimsoft Inc.
